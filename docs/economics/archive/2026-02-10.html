<h3>Mass Deportations Could Cost Americans $100+ Billion in Lost Wages</h3>
<p class="paper-meta"><strong>Title:</strong> The Economic Impact of Mass Deportations | <strong>Authors:</strong> Javier Cravino, Andrei A. Levchenko, Francesc Ortega, Nitya Pandalai-Nayar</p>
<p>This groundbreaking study quantifies what large-scale deportations would actually cost the U.S. economy, finding that removing unauthorized workers—who make up 3.2% of the workforce but are concentrated in key sectors—would significantly reduce wages, increase prices, and lower real incomes for American workers. Using a sophisticated economic model that tracks regional and sectoral dependencies, the researchers show how immigration enforcement creates complex ripple effects that ultimately harm the very workers such policies claim to protect. The timing couldn't be more relevant for current policy debates.</p>

<h3>AI Can Now Predict Your Salary From Your Headshot</h3>
<p class="paper-meta"><strong>Title:</strong> AI Personality Extraction from Faces: Labor Market Implications | <strong>Authors:</strong> Marius Guenzel, Shimon Kogan, Marina Niessner, Kelly Shue</p>
<p>Researchers trained AI to extract personality traits from LinkedIn photos of 96,000 MBA graduates and found it can predict career success as well as traditional factors like race and education. The "Photo Big 5" personality scores derived from facial images alone forecast job matching, compensation, career advancement, and job transitions with startling accuracy. This breakthrough—and deeply unsettling—finding reveals how AI could revolutionize (or discriminate in) hiring practices while raising profound questions about privacy and algorithmic bias in the digital economy.</p>

<h3>Cold War 2.0: How Geopolitics is Killing Scientific Collaboration</h3>
<p class="paper-meta"><strong>Title:</strong> Geopolitics in the Evaluation of International Scientific Collaboration | <strong>Authors:</strong> Alexander C. Furnas, Ruixue Jia, Margaret E. Roberts, Dashun Wang</p>
<p>Two massive randomized experiments with U.S. policymakers and scientists reveal systematic discrimination against research proposals involving Chinese collaborators, with support dropping from 68% for Germany-based partners to just 44% for identical proposals with China-based researchers. This 24-percentage-point penalty demonstrates how rising U.S.-China tensions are fracturing the global scientific enterprise, potentially slowing innovation and discovery at precisely the moment when international cooperation is most needed for challenges like climate change and pandemic preparedness.</p>

                                <p><em>This week brings fresh perspectives on long-standing macroeconomic puzzles, from measuring inflation correctly to understanding how global shocks increasingly drive domestic business cycles.</em></p>

<h3><a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w34806#fromrss">Heaven or Earth? The Evolving Role of Global Shocks for Domestic Monetary Policy</a></h3>
<p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kristin Forbes, Jongrim Ha, M. Ayhan Kose</p>
<p>Using a novel FAVAR model spanning 1970-2024, the authors find that global shocks—rather than domestic demand shocks—increasingly drive business cycles in advanced economies. They decompose economic movements into seven distinct shocks and show that global forces now play a dramatically larger role than in previous decades. Why it matters: This shift fundamentally challenges how central banks should design monetary policy and communicate with markets when domestic tools have less influence over domestic outcomes.</p>

<h3><a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w34803#fromrss">Inferring Prices from Quantities</a></h3>
<p><strong>Authors:</strong> David Argente, Chang-Tai Hsieh, Munseob Lee</p>
<p>The researchers develop a method to measure aggregate inflation that sidesteps two major biases: unobserved quality improvements and incorrect weighting of new products. Using 60 years of BEA data, they find that true inflation has been 0.3 to 1.0 percentage points higher per year than official measures suggest. Why it matters: If confirmed, this finding implies that real economic growth has been systematically overstated, with significant implications for productivity assessments and long-term fiscal projections.</p>

<h3><a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w34820#fromrss">Are Government Bonds Safe in Times of War and Pandemic?</a></h3>
<p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhengyang Jiang, Hanno Lustig, Stijn Van Nieuwerburgh, Mindy Z. Xiaolan</p>
<p>Analyzing three centuries of U.S. and U.K. debt, the authors reveal that wars generate sharply negative real returns on government bonds, with surprise inflation and financial repression creating a 31% cumulative wedge between returns and growth over four war years. During peacetime, bonds typically outperform economic growth, but this relationship flips during conflicts. Why it matters: This challenges the conventional view of government bonds as ultimate safe assets, suggesting bondholders systematically bear wartime fiscal costs through financial repression.</p>

<h3><a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w34817#fromrss">International Currency Dominance</a></h3>
<p><strong>Authors:</strong> Joseph Abadi, Jesús Fernández-Villaverde, Daniel Sanches</p>
<p>The authors present a micro-founded model explaining why international monetary systems tend toward single dominant currencies rather than multipolar arrangements. Large economies have natural advantages in currency competition, and governments can compete by offering attractive interest rates on sovereign debt, though historical path dependence plays a crucial role. Why it matters: As debates intensify over the dollar's international role and potential challengers, this framework provides theoretical grounding for understanding currency competition dynamics.</p>

<h3><a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w34790#fromrss">The Economic Impact of Mass Deportations</a></h3>
<p><strong>Authors:</strong> Javier Cravino, Andrei A. Levchenko, Francesc Ortega, Nitya Pandalai-Nayar</p>
<p>Researchers developed a comprehensive model to analyze how large-scale deportations would affect wages, prices, and real incomes across different U.S. regions and sectors. They find that while unauthorized workers make up just 3.2% of the workforce nationally, some regions and industries are heavily dependent on this labor. The study provides crucial quantitative insights into how removing these workers would ripple through the economy via changing labor supply and capital accumulation. Why it matters: This research offers data-driven analysis of a major policy debate, helping inform discussions with economic evidence rather than speculation.</p>

<h3><a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w34808#fromrss">AI Personality Extraction from Faces: Labor Market Implications</a></h3>
<p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marius Guenzel, Shimon Kogan, Marina Niessner, Kelly Shue</p>
<p>Using AI to analyze facial images of 96,000 MBA graduates, researchers extracted Big 5 personality traits and found these "Photo Big 5" scores predict career outcomes including job placement, compensation, and advancement. The study shows people systematically sort into occupations where their personality traits are valued and earn higher wages when traits align with job demands. Remarkably, facial-based personality measures proved as predictive as race, attractiveness, and educational background. Why it matters: This raises profound questions about hiring bias and privacy as AI tools become more sophisticated at reading personality from appearance.</p>

<h3><a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w34802#fromrss">Competition and Fraud in Health Care</a></h3>
<p><strong>Authors:</strong> Renuka M. Diwan, Paul J. Eliason, Riley League, Jetson Leder-Luis, Ryan C. McDevitt, James W. Roberts</p>
<p>Studying Medicare's switch from regulated pricing to competitive bidding for medical equipment, researchers discovered an unintended consequence: fraudulent firms gained market share as legitimate companies exited due to reduced margins. While competition successfully lowered costs, it also created conditions where only firms willing to operate fraudulently could remain profitable in some markets. Why it matters: This highlights a critical tradeoff policymakers face when introducing competition to government procurement—lower costs may come at the expense of quality and integrity.</p>

<h3><a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w34787#fromrss">Protest Matters: The Effects of Protests on Economic Redistribution</a></h3>
<p><strong>Authors:</strong> Belinda Archibong, Chinemelu Okafor, Evans S. Osabuohien, Tom Moerenhout</p>
<p>Analyzing 26 years of Nigerian public finance data, researchers found that citizen protests do lead to increased government transfers—but only to regions politically aligned with the ruling government. The 2012 Occupy Nigeria protests confirmed this pattern, while protesters in non-aligned regions faced greater police violence instead of fiscal benefits. Why it matters: This reveals how political alignment can determine whether civic engagement translates into economic gains, offering insights into the mechanics of democratic responsiveness.</p>

<h3><a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w34796#fromrss">Clustered Network Connectedness: A New Measurement Framework, with Application to Global Equity Markets</a></h3>
<p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bastien Buchwalter, Francis X. Diebold, Kamil Yilmaz</p>
<p>The authors extend the popular Diebold-Yilmaz network connectedness framework by developing a more flexible approach that allows for "clustered" connections between network nodes. Rather than requiring full orthogonalization or no orthogonalization of shocks in vector autoregressions, their method permits intermediate cases where shocks are orthogonal across clusters but correlated within them. Why it matters: This advancement provides economists with more nuanced tools to measure financial contagion and spillovers across different asset classes, industries, or regions.</p>

<h3><a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w34788#fromrss">Coca's Return and the American Overdose Fallout</a></h3>
<p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xinming Du, Benjamin Hansen, Shan Zhang, Eric Zou</p>
<p>Using an unexpected supply shock from Colombia's coca boom after 2015, the researchers exploit cross-county variation in pre-shock cocaine exposure to identify causal effects on U.S. overdose mortality. They find that increased Colombian coca cultivation directly contributed to 1,000-1,500 additional American deaths annually in the late 2010s, with effects appearing almost immediately after the supply surge. Why it matters: This study demonstrates how natural experiments in international drug markets can provide clean identification for understanding domestic public health outcomes.</p>

<p><strong>Authors:</strong> Manuel Adelino, Bin Wei, Feng Zhao</p>
<p>The paper develops a dynamic model where mortgage originators signal loan quality through delayed sale timing, then tests it using processing time as a proxy for screening effort. Consistent with theory, loans taking longer to process are sold with greater delay and have lower default rates, despite observably riskier loans requiring more processing time. Why it matters: This work provides new insights into information asymmetries in financial markets and suggests the subprime crisis may have reflected endogenous market fragility.</p>

<p>Using generalized difference-in-differences methodology, the researchers evaluate the first comprehensive analysis of K-12 school vaping restrictions across 40 states. They find minimal evidence that these policies reduce youth ENDS use, with confidence intervals ruling out reductions larger than 3.5%. Why it matters: The null results highlight the challenges of regulating youth substance use through location-based restrictions and suggest potential behavioral substitution toward less detectable devices.</p>
