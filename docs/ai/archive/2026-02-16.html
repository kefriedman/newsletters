                                <h3>New Method Makes LLM Training Work on Mobile Phones</h3>
<p>Researchers developed LCSB, a technique that enables fine-tuning large language models directly on mobile devices with less than 1GB of memory. By computing gradients for only a subset of layers at each training step, they reduced memory usage by up to 42% while maintaining training quality. This could enable truly private AI personalization without sending data to the cloud.</p>
