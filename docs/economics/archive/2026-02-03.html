<h3>AI Triples Book Publishing but Floods Market with Low-Quality Content</h3>
<p class="paper-meta"><strong>Title:</strong> AI and the Quantity and Quality of Creative Products: Have LLMs Boosted Creation of Valuable Books? | <strong>Authors:</strong> Imke Reimers, Joel Waldfogel</p>
<p>The rise of large language models has triggered a publishing explosion, with new book releases tripling between 2022 and 2025. However, this AI-driven boom comes with a dark side: the average quality of books has plummeted as measured by reader ratings. While the top 1,000 monthly releases in each category actually show higher quality than before, the flood of low-quality content from new AI-assisted authors threatens to overwhelm readers and reshape the creative economy. This research provides the first rigorous evidence of AI's dual impact on creative industries—boosting both quantity and inequality in quality.</p>

<h3>Remote Work Triggered $557 Billion Office Real Estate Collapse</h3>
<p class="paper-meta"><strong>Title:</strong> Work from Home and the Office Real Estate Apocalypse | <strong>Authors:</strong> Arpit Gupta, Vrinda Mittal, Stijn Van Nieuwerburgh</p>
<p>The shift to remote work has caused a catastrophic 46% decline in New York City office building values, with a staggering $556.8 billion in value destruction across all U.S. office markets. This isn't just a real estate story—it's an economic earthquake with major implications for financial stability, municipal budgets, and urban development. The research reveals a stark divide emerging between high-quality "flight to quality" buildings and lower-tier offices at risk of becoming stranded assets, fundamentally reshaping America's urban landscape.</p>

<h3>Inflation Sparked Historic Job-Hopping Wave as Workers Chased Real Wages</h3>
<p class="paper-meta"><strong>Title:</strong> A Theory of How Workers Keep up with Inflation | <strong>Authors:</strong> Hassan Afrouzi, Andres Blanco, Andres Drenik, Erik Hurst</p>
<p>This groundbreaking research solves a key puzzle of the 2021-2024 inflation period: why labor markets appeared tight with high job vacancies despite falling real wages. The answer lies in sticky nominal wages that incentivized workers to switch jobs en masse after unexpected price increases. The study reveals that job-to-job transitions became workers' primary tool for maintaining purchasing power during inflationary periods, creating a feedback loop that kept vacancy rates high even as real compensation lagged. This finding fundamentally changes how economists should think about labor market dynamics during inflationary episodes.</p>

<h3>The Academic Finance Crisis Deepens</h3>
<p><span class="source">Marginal Revolution</span> — A provocative new study suggests peer-reviewed finance research performs no better than random data mining when predicting stock returns, with both methods showing similar ~50% predictability rates. This finding challenges the entire foundation of academic finance theory. <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2026/02/does-peer-reviewed-research-help-predict-stock-returns.html?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=does-peer-reviewed-research-help-predict-stock-returns">Read more</a></p>

<h3>Markets vs. Community: A False Choice?</h3>

<h3><a href="https://doi.org/10.1257/aer.20230432">Consumer Credit and the Incidence of Tariffs: Evidence from the Auto Industry</a></h3>
<p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kristine Watson Hankins, Morteza Momeni, David Sovich</p>
<p>The Trump administration's metal tariffs didn't just raise car prices—they also made car loans more expensive. When automakers faced higher steel costs from tariffs, their financing arms (captive lenders) responded by charging consumers higher interest rates compared to independent lenders. Low-income borrowers and those in areas with less lending competition were hit hardest. Why it matters: This suggests economists have been significantly underestimating the true cost of tariffs by focusing only on product prices while ignoring financing costs.</p>

<h3><a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/qje/qjag007">A Theory of How Workers Keep up with Inflation</a></h3>
<p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hassan Afrouzi, Andres Blanco, Andres Drenik, Erik Hurst</p>
<p>When inflation hits unexpectedly, workers don't just wait for raises—they jump to new jobs. This study shows that sticky wages during the 2021-2024 inflation period led workers to switch jobs more frequently to maintain their purchasing power, creating the paradox of a seemingly tight labor market with declining real wages. The researchers found similar patterns in historical inflation episodes, revealing a consistent behavioral response across decades. Why it matters: This helps explain why recent labor market indicators have seemed contradictory and suggests policymakers need to look beyond traditional metrics when assessing economic conditions.</p>

<h3><a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w34775#fromrss">Immigration Restrictions and Natives' Intergenerational Mobility: Evidence from the 1920s US Quota Acts</a></h3>
<p><strong>Authors:</strong> James J. Feigenbaum, Yi-Ju Hung, Marco Tabellini, Monia Tomasella</p>
<p>The 1920s immigration quotas that restricted European immigration had unintended consequences for American-born workers decades later. By following families from 1900 to 1940, researchers found that areas most affected by immigration restrictions saw reduced economic mobility for white American men—they were less likely to climb the income ladder than their fathers. Interestingly, Black Americans saw no such adverse effects, and wealthy white families could escape the negative impacts by moving away. Why it matters: This provides crucial historical evidence that immigration restrictions can backfire, hurting the very native-born workers they're meant to protect.</p>

<h3><a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w34785#fromrss">Trade and US Inequality in the Tokyo Round</a></h3>
<p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrew Greenland, James Lake, John Lopresti</p>
<p>The Tokyo Round of trade negotiations in the late 1970s reduced US tariffs by 1.6 percentage points—a larger cut than NAFTA or China's entry into the WTO. This liberalization explains about 20% of the rise in wage inequality between skilled and unskilled workers during the 1980s, with women and workers in routine jobs bearing the brunt of the impact. Why it matters: This research provides some of the clearest evidence to date linking specific trade deals to rising inequality, informing current debates about globalization's costs and benefits.</p>

<h3><a href="https://doi.org/10.1257/aer.20221345">Competition under Incomplete Contracts and the Design of Procurement Policies</a></h3>
<p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rodrigo Carril, Andrés González-Lira, Michael S. Walker</p>
<p>More competition isn't always better—at least in US Defense procurement. While expanding the pool of bidders successfully reduces contract prices, it comes with a hidden cost: worse performance in the form of significant cost overruns and delays. The researchers found substantial variation in contractor capabilities, suggesting that simply opening bidding to more firms can inadvertently select lower-quality providers. Why it matters: This challenges conventional wisdom about competition and suggests procurement policies need to balance price competition with performance quality.</p>

<h3><a href="https://doi.org/10.1257/aer.20240443">A Theory of Supply Function Choice and Aggregate Supply</a></h3>
<p><strong>Authors:</strong> Joel P. Flynn, George Nikolakoudis, Karthik A. Sastry</p>
<p>Instead of just setting prices and meeting whatever demand follows, what if firms strategically choose how much to supply at different price levels? This fundamental shift in thinking about firm behavior reveals that aggregate supply becomes flatter during periods of low inflation uncertainty (like the Great Moderation) and steeper during volatile times (like the 1970s and 2020s). The model shows how uncertainty shapes not just individual firm decisions but entire economic responses to shocks. Why it matters: This provides a new lens for understanding why the economy's sensitivity to shocks has varied dramatically across different eras.</p>

<h3><a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w34777#fromrss">AI and the Quantity and Quality of Creative Products: Have LLMs Boosted Creation of Valuable Books?</a></h3>
<p><strong>Authors:</strong> Imke Reimers, Joel Waldfogel</p>
<p>The AI revolution has tripled new book releases since 2022, but with a twist: while average quality has declined due to an influx of low-quality content, the best books have actually gotten better. The top tier of monthly releases shows higher quality than before the AI boom, especially in categories with the fastest growth in new titles. Surprisingly, it's established authors—not AI newcomers—driving the quality improvements at the top. Why it matters: This suggests AI tools may be creating a bifurcated creative economy where technology amplifies both the best and worst content, potentially increasing overall consumer welfare despite flooding markets with mediocre work.</p>

<h3><a href="https://doi.org/10.1257/aer.20211324">Raising the Stakes: Physician Facility Investments and Provider Agency</a></h3>
<p><strong>Authors:</strong> Elizabeth L. Munnich, Michael R. Richards, Christopher Whaley, Xiaoxi Zhao</p>
<p>When physicians invest in ambulatory surgery centers, they don't exploit patients—they actually reduce healthcare costs. The study finds that physician ownership of same-day surgical facilities leads to a shift away from more expensive hospital settings, cutting Medicare spending by 10-40 percent per physician without evidence of harmful corner-cutting. Why it matters: This demonstrates how aligning financial incentives through entrepreneurial ownership can solve principal-agent problems and improve system efficiency, challenging assumptions about conflicts of interest in healthcare.</p>

<p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alan Benson, Danielle Li, Kelly Shue</p>
<p>Using data from nearly 30,000 management-track retail employees, this study reveals a striking paradox: women receive higher performance ratings but lower "potential" ratings than men, and these potential assessments account for half the gender promotion gap. The kicker? Women actually outperform their male colleagues after promotion, suggesting these potential ratings reflect bias rather than accurate forecasting. Why it matters: This provides concrete evidence of how subjective evaluations perpetuate workplace inequality even when objective performance measures favor women.</p>

<p>This massive study of a $17 billion housing revitalization program uses matched difference-in-differences to show that while HOPE VI successfully reduced neighborhood poverty by attracting higher-income residents, it had no effect on existing adult earnings. However, children raised in revitalized developments experienced significant long-term benefits: higher earnings, increased college attendance, and lower incarceration rates.

<p>In a counterintuitive finding from a randomized experiment with 553 tech startups across 12 co-working spaces, intensive entrepreneurial training actually increased shutdown rates and reduced the time to shutdown. However, surviving trained startups were more likely to raise external funding, raise it faster, and raise more money than control groups. Why it matters: It suggests that entrepreneurship education helps founders make better decisions about when to persist versus when to pivot, potentially improving overall market efficiency.</p>
