<h3>Remote Work Triggered a $557 Billion Commercial Real Estate Collapse</h3>
<p class="paper-meta"><strong>Title:</strong> Work from Home and the Office Real Estate Apocalypse | <strong>Authors:</strong> Arpit Gupta, Vrinda Mittal, Stijn Van Nieuwerburgh</p>
<p>The shift to remote work has devastated commercial office real estate, with researchers finding a staggering 46% decline in long-run property values in New York City alone. Across all US office markets, the total value destruction reaches $556.8 billion as lease revenues plummet and occupancy rates crater. The study reveals a stark flight to quality, where premium buildings maintain some value while lower-tier offices risk becoming completely stranded assets—with serious implications for financial stability as banks and investors face massive losses.</p>

<h3>How Inflation Forces Workers to Job-Hop Just to Keep Up</h3>
<p class="paper-meta"><strong>Title:</strong> A Theory of How Workers Keep up with Inflation | <strong>Authors:</strong> Hassan Afrouzi, Andres Blanco, Andres Drenik, Erik Hurst</p>
<p>This groundbreaking study explains the puzzling phenomenon of recent years: why labor markets appeared "tight" even as real wages fell during high inflation periods. The researchers show that when prices rise unexpectedly, sticky nominal wages force workers to frantically switch jobs to maintain their purchasing power. Their model successfully explains the seemingly contradictory trends of 2021-2024, where high job vacancy rates coexisted with declining real wages—fundamentally changing how we understand inflation's impact on labor markets.</p>

<h3>AI Bubble or Boom? Why Speculative Growth May Be Rational After All</h3>
<p class="paper-meta"><strong>Title:</strong> Speculative Growth and the AI "Bubble" | <strong>Authors:</strong> Ricardo J. Caballero</p>
<p>High AI valuations aren't necessarily irrational exuberance—they could represent a fragile but rational equilibrium where elevated stock prices actually enable the rapid capital accumulation they seem to anticipate. Unlike traditional capital, AI acts more like labor by expanding effective workforce capacity without the usual diminishing returns, creating a "funding feedback" loop where rising asset values finance their own growth. This theoretical framework suggests that what looks like a speculative bubble might be a self-fulfilling prophecy of genuine technological transformation, though one that remains precariously dependent on coordinated market beliefs.</p>

Several papers highlight the complex, often unexpected channels through which economic policies affect households and markets.</em></p>

<h3><a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/qje/qjag007">A Theory of How Workers Keep up with Inflation</a></h3>
<p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hassan Afrouzi, Andres Blanco, Andres Drenik, Erik Hurst</p>
<p>This paper offers a fresh perspective on the recent inflation period by showing how nominal wage stickiness drives workers to switch jobs more frequently when prices rise unexpectedly. The model explains the puzzling combination of tight labor markets alongside declining real wages observed during 2021-2024. Why it matters: This research suggests that traditional measures of labor market tightness may be misleading during inflationary periods, with important implications for monetary policy.</p>

<h3><a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w34728#fromrss">Global Trade, Tariff Uncertainty and the U.S. Dollar</a></h3>
<p><strong>Authors:</strong> Şebnem Kalemli-Özcan, Can Soylu, Muhammed A. Yildirim</p>
<p>The authors tackle the counterintuitive finding that the U.S. dollar weakened following 2025 tariff announcements, despite standard models predicting currency appreciation from unilateral tariffs. They demonstrate that policy uncertainty can overwhelm the direct tariff effect through increased precautionary savings and risk premiums. Why it matters: This challenges conventional wisdom about trade policy effects and highlights how policy uncertainty can dominate direct economic impacts in financial markets.</p>

<h3><a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w34748#fromrss">A Macroeconomic Perspective on Stock Market Valuation Ratios</a></h3>
<p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrew Atkeson, Jonathan Heathcote, Fabrizio Perri</p>
<p>Rather than attributing elevated U.S. stock valuations to speculative bubbles, this research shows how declining labor's share of corporate output combined with weak investment mechanically drives up valuation ratios. The shift in income distribution toward capital owners explains persistently high market valuations over the past 25-30 years. Why it matters: This provides a fundamental explanation for "expensive" markets that doesn't rely on irrational exuberance or changing discount rates.</p>

<p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kristine Watson Hankins, Morteza Momeni, David Sovich</p>
<p>This study uncovers a previously hidden channel of tariff impact: automotive companies' captive finance subsidiaries raised interest rates on car loans following Trump-era metal tariffs, with low-income borrowers hit hardest. The research demonstrates that tariff effects extend beyond product prices to financing terms. Why it matters: Traditional measures of tariff pass-through may significantly underestimate the true burden on consumers by ignoring credit market effects.</p>

<h3><a href="https://doi.org/10.1257/aer.20230264">Take the Goods and Run: Contracting Frictions and Market Power in Supply Chains</a></h3>
<p><strong>Authors:</strong> Felipe Brugués</p>
<p>Using novel data from Ecuadorian manufacturing, this study reveals how suppliers and buyers build trust over time when contracts can't be legally enforced. Early in business relationships, trade volumes are inefficiently low as parties worry about defaults, but efficiency improves as trust develops through repeated interactions. Why it matters: Shows how informal relationship-building can partially overcome weak legal institutions, though market power still creates persistent inefficiencies.</p>

<h3><a href="https://doi.org/10.1257/aer.20211219">Financial Frictions: Micro versus Macro Volatility</a></h3>
<p><strong>Authors:</strong> Renato Faccini, Seungcheol Lee, Ralph Luetticke, Morten O. Ravn</p>
<p>Analyzing Danish household data, researchers find that consumer credit spreads have vastly different impacts across the wealth distribution, with poorer households showing much higher sensitivity to credit costs. When credit becomes more expensive during downturns, it disproportionately affects low-wealth consumers, amplifying economic volatility. Why it matters: Suggests that banking regulations focused on stability may inadvertently increase inequality and household-level economic risk.</p>

<h3><a href="https://doi.org/10.1257/aer.20221345">Competition under Incomplete Contracts and the Design of Procurement Policies</a></h3>
<p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rodrigo Carril, Andrés González-Lira, Michael S. Walker</p>
<p>A study of US Defense procurement reveals a troubling trade-off: while opening contracts to more bidders reduces initial prices, it leads to worse performance with more cost overruns and delays. The research shows this happens because high-quality contractors face the same bidding requirements as low-quality ones, creating adverse selection. Why it matters: Demonstrates that simply increasing competition isn't always better—procurement rules need to account for quality differences among potential contractors.</p>

<h3><a href="https://doi.org/10.1257/aer.20211324">Raising the Stakes: Physician Facility Investments and Provider Agency</a></h3>
<p><strong>Authors:</strong> Elizabeth L. Munnich, Michael R. Richards, Christopher Whaley, Xiaoxi Zhao</p>
<p>When physicians invest in ambulatory surgery centers, they shift procedures away from more expensive hospitals, reducing Medicare spending by 10-40% per physician without apparent harm to patient outcomes. This suggests that giving healthcare providers financial stakes in cost-effective facilities can align their incentives with broader cost-containment goals. Why it matters: Offers a market-based approach to controlling healthcare costs by making providers partial owners of efficient treatment facilities.</p>

<h3><a href="https://doi.org/10.1257/aer.20240443">A Theory of Supply Function Choice and Aggregate Supply</a></h3>
<p><strong>Authors:</strong> Joel P. Flynn, George Nikolakoudis, Karthik A. Sastry</p>
<p>Rather than just setting prices, this research shows firms strategically choose entire supply functions that determine pricing at different production levels. The resulting aggregate supply curves become flatter when inflation is stable and steeper during volatile periods. Why it matters: Provides new theoretical foundations for understanding how macroeconomic stability affects firm pricing behavior and aggregate economic responses.</p>

                                <p><em>This week brings compelling new evidence on how subjective evaluations can perpetuate workplace inequality, with rigorous econometric analysis revealing hidden biases in performance assessment systems.</em></p>

<h3><a href="https://doi.org/10.1257/aer.20220831">"Potential" and the Gender Promotion Gap</a></h3>
<p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alan Benson, Danielle Li, Kelly Shue</p>
<p>This groundbreaking study uses data from nearly 30,000 management-track employees at a major retail chain to uncover a troubling paradox: women consistently receive higher performance ratings than men, yet are systematically rated as having lower "potential" for advancement. The authors' careful econometric analysis reveals that these subjective potential assessments explain approximately half of the gender promotion gap, even though women subsequently outperform their male colleagues who were promoted instead. The research identifies two key mechanisms driving this bias: managers strategically giving women lower potential ratings to retain high-performing employees in their current roles, and gender stereotyping that causes evaluators to discount women's leadership capabilities. Why it matters: This paper provides concrete evidence of how seemingly objective evaluation systems can perpetuate gender inequality, offering crucial insights for organizations seeking to design fairer promotion processes.</p>

<h3>Looking Ahead</h3>
<p>While this week featured fewer new econometric papers than usual, the Benson, Li, and Shue study represents exactly the kind of rigorous empirical work that makes econometrics so valuable for understanding real-world phenomena. Their identification strategy cleverly exploits variation in manager characteristics and employee performance trajectories to isolate the causal impact of subjective evaluations on career outcomes.</p>

<p>The paper also showcases several important econometric techniques worth noting: the authors use decomposition methods to quantify how much of the promotion gap can be attributed to different factors, employ regression discontinuity approaches around promotion thresholds, and utilize panel data methods to track employee outcomes over time. Their robustness checks, including placebo tests and alternative model specifications, demonstrate the careful empirical work needed to establish credible causal claims about workplace discrimination.</p>

<p>For readers interested in labor economics and applied econometrics, this paper offers a masterclass in how to use large-scale administrative data to uncover subtle forms of bias that might otherwise remain hidden. The findings have immediate practical implications for human resource policies and highlight the ongoing importance of econometric analysis in documenting and understanding inequality in the modern workplace.</p>

<p>Next week, we expect to see new papers from several major conferences and working paper series, with anticipated releases covering topics ranging from causal inference methods to applications in development economics. As always, we'll highlight the most significant methodological advances and compelling empirical findings that demonstrate the power of econometric analysis to illuminate important economic questions.</p>
