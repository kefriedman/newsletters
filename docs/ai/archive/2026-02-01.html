                                <h3>New Method Cuts LLM Costs by Using "Hints" Instead of Full Responses</h3>
<p>Researchers developed "LLM Shepherding," which dramatically reduces inference costs by having large models provide short hints to guide smaller, cheaper models rather than generating complete responses. This approach cuts costs by 2-10x while maintaining accuracy, making advanced AI more accessible for production deployments where cost is a major barrier.</p>

<h3>AI Models Learn to Ask Questions When They Need More Information</h3>
<p>Instead of making assumptions or hallucinating when information is missing, this "Proactive Interactive Reasoning" approach teaches AI systems to ask clarifying questions before solving problems. This could significantly improve reliability in real-world applications where context is often incomplete, from customer service bots to technical support systems.</p>

<h3>New Benchmark Measures When AI Safety Systems Catch Problems</h3>
<p>StepShield introduces the first benchmark that measures timing of safety interventions—whether violations are caught early enough to prevent harm or only detected after damage is done. This addresses a critical gap in AI safety evaluation, as current metrics only measure if problems are eventually detected, not whether detection happens fast enough to matter.</p>
